# Deploying God's Eye View

This app **cannot** run on GitHub Pages, Netlify's static tier, or any other
static host. About 25 API endpoints (the CCTV frame proxy, flights, satellites,
geocoding, weather, radio) live in the Vite server. Without Node running, the
globe loads and every data layer 404s.

It needs a host that runs Node 24.14.x or 26.x.

## One-click: Render (free tier)

The repo carries a `render.yaml` Blueprint, so Render configures itself.

1. Go to <https://render.com> and sign in **with GitHub**.
2. **New → Blueprint**, pick this repository, click **Apply**.
3. When prompted, paste your `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. It is the only required
   secret, and it is never committed — `.env` is gitignored.
4. Wait for the first build (a few minutes; the Cesium bundle is large).

After that, **every `git push` to the default branch redeploys automatically** —
`autoDeploy: true` in the Blueprint.

### Restrict your Google key BEFORE the site is public

The key is injected into the browser bundle by design and is readable by anyone
who opens devtools. Map Tiles is billed per session, so an unrestricted key on a
public URL is a genuine financial risk.

Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → your key →
**Application restrictions → Websites** → add `https://<your-app>.onrender.com/*`.
Then **API restrictions** → limit it to Map Tiles, Geocoding, Places (New) and
Street View Static.

### Free-tier caveat

Render's free web services sleep after ~15 minutes idle and take ~30–60 seconds
to wake. Fine for a personal deployment; upgrade if you want it always warm.

## Camera licensing — read this before widening the deployment

Public visibility is not permission to redistribute. `render.yaml` deliberately
disables the packs whose terms forbid it:

| Pack | Cameras | Terms |
|---|---|---|
| FDOT FL511 (Miami) | 887 | *"individual use only … not available for re-sale or re-use without the express written consent of FDOT"* |
| Autostrade (Italy) | ~700 | All rights reserved |
| GMCVB / Ozolio | 4 | Permission required |
| WeatherSTEM | 2 | Written permission required |
| Vedetta | 1 | No terms published |
| SANRAL (South Africa) | 1,238 | Already disabled in the registry |
| BayernInfo (Bavaria) | 946 | Personal / non-commercial only — never added |

Everything left enabled is openly licensed: Open Government Licence (BC,
Ontario, Toronto, Calgary), CC BY 4.0 (Finland, Spanish cities, Queensland),
CC0 (Sweden), NLOD (Norway), CC BY (NSW), CC BY-SA (Illinois), and Hong Kong,
whose terms expressly permit commercial use free of charge.

Your **local** instance keeps all of them — `.env` is untouched by any of this.
Drafts for the three permission emails are in
`docs/licensing/PERMISSION-REQUESTS.md`; once a reply lands, remove that pack's
`_ENABLED=0` line from `render.yaml`.

## Other hosts

Anything that runs Node works the same way:

```bash
npm ci && npm run build
PORT=8080 npm start
```

Railway and Fly.io need only that plus the same environment variables.
Vercel and Cloudflare Pages do **not** fit without porting the middleware to
their serverless function formats.
