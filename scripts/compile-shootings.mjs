/**
 * Compile the civilian mass-shooting dataset.
 *
 *   node scripts/compile-shootings.mjs
 *
 * Writes data/shootings.json, which /api/shootings serves.
 *
 * SOURCE: Wikidata, via its public SPARQL endpoint.
 *
 * Wikidata is the only source found that clears every bar at once. A survey of
 * the alternatives (see docs/SHOOTINGS-DATA.md) found the well-known catalogues
 * are all licence-blocked for redistribution:
 *
 *   Gun Violence Archive .......... explicitly proprietary, no redistribution
 *   Mother Jones .................. no open licence
 *   The Violence Project .......... gated, redistribution forbidden
 *   Everytown ..................... reuse prohibited by terms
 *   Global Terrorism Database ..... restrictive proprietary EULA
 *   ACLED ......................... not redistributable
 *   gunviolence.eu ................ redistribution explicitly forbidden
 *
 * Wikidata's structured data is CC0 — a public-domain dedication — so it can be
 * compiled and redistributed without restriction. It is also the only source
 * that is genuinely global rather than a single country's catalogue.
 *
 * SCOPE. Four classes, all firearm-specific and civilian:
 *   Q21480300  mass shooting
 *   Q473853    school shooting
 *   Q118188839 spree shooting
 *   Q42915628  mass shooting in the United States
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included: Q3199915 "massacre" and Q750215 "mass murder".
 * Those sweep in armed-conflict killings — a first pass using them returned
 * things like a 102-death event in Sudan in 2009, which is a war massacre, not
 * a civilian mass shooting. They are a different subject with different data
 * and merging them would misrepresent both.
 *
 * The classes alone still let conflict events through, because Wikidata types
 * many of them as mass shootings TOO. The query therefore also excludes
 * anything additionally typed as a massacre, war, suicide bombing or military
 * operation, and anything that is `part of` a named armed conflict. That last
 * one does most of the work: it is what separates an insurgency attack from a
 * lone attacker in a shopping centre.
 *
 * Terrorist attacks are NOT excluded. Some of the worst civilian mass shootings
 * — Christchurch, Utoya — are classed as terrorism, and dropping them to be
 * tidy would misrepresent the subject just as badly as including a war.
 *
 * PERPETRATORS ARE NEVER QUERIED. Not fetched, not stored, not stripped later —
 * the SELECT simply does not ask for them. Wikidata holds them; this dataset
 * does not. See src/data/shootings.js for the reasoning.
