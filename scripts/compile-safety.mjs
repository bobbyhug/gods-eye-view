/**
 * Compile the world safety dataset.
 *
 *   node scripts/compile-safety.mjs
 *
 * Writes data/safety.json, which /api/safety serves.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MEASURES: intentional homicide per 100,000 people, per country.
 *
 * That is a deliberate choice and worth defending. "How dangerous is this
 * place" has no single number, and most candidates are worse:
 *
 *   - Total crime counts reward small countries and punish large ones.
 *   - Composite "safety indices" (Numbeo and similar) are built from unweighted
 *     visitor surveys, are proprietary, and cannot be redistributed.
 *   - Theft and robbery rates track REPORTING as much as offending: a country
 *     where people trust the police enough to file a report scores worse than
 *     one where nobody bothers.
 *
 * Homicide is the least distorted of the available measures. A body is hard to
 * not record, so it survives differences in reporting culture better than any
 * other crime statistic, which is exactly why the UN uses it as its headline
 * indicator. It is still a proxy, not a verdict, and the layer says so.
 *
 * HUMAN-CAUSED ONLY, as requested: this counts people killed by other people.
 * Earthquakes, storms, floods and disease are not in it.
 *
 * SOURCES
 *   World Bank indicator VC.IHR.PSRC.P5, sourced from the UN Office on Drugs
 *   and Crime. Licence CC BY 4.0.
