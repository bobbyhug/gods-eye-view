/**
 * Cheap cursor-affordance hover picking.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two layers ran a GPU readback on every raw mousemove, purely
 * to decide whether the cursor should be a pointer.
 *
 * `Scene.drillPick` is the most expensive call in Cesium's public API: it draws
 * the scene into the pick framebuffer, issues a SYNCHRONOUS gl.readPixels — which
 * stalls the CPU until the GPU drains — then hides whatever it found and draws
 * again, repeating up to its limit. At a limit of 12 that is up to twelve scene
 * renders and twelve pipeline stalls. `scene.pickPosition` is cheaper but still
 * a synchronous depth-buffer readback.
 *
 * MOUSE_MOVE fires per DOM mousemove, which on a 120 Hz trackpad is up to 120
 * times a second. So moving the pointer across the map could ask for well over a
 * thousand scene renders a second, and the only thing done with the answer was
 * setting a CSS cursor.
 *
 * Three things make it cheap, in descending order of effect:
 *
 *   1. Skip entirely while the camera is moving. During a drag the cursor
 *      affordance is irrelevant and the readback competes with the thing the
 *      user is actually doing.
 *   2. Coalesce to one animation frame and gate on elapsed time and distance.
 *      A pointer that has not moved four pixels cannot have crossed onto a
 *      different target.
 *   3. Prefer `scene.pick` over `drillPick`. The topmost hit IS the right
 *      answer for "what would clicking do", and it is a single pass.
 *
 * The CCTV gizmo already time-gated its own MOUSE_MOVE; these two just missed
 * it, so this makes the pattern shared rather than remembered.
