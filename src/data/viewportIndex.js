/**
 * Viewport culling for point layers.
 *
 * THE WASTE THIS REMOVES. A layer holds every point it has ever loaded and
 * hands all of them to the renderer, whatever the camera is looking at. Flying
 * over Austin with the wildfire layer on means 9,319 fires are built, uploaded
 * and drawn so that perhaps forty of them can be seen. The cost is paid on
 * every rebuild, and it grows with each layer added rather than with what is
 * actually on screen.
 *
 * An R-tree answers "which points fall inside this rectangle" in roughly log
 * time instead of testing every point, so the working set becomes a function of
 * the VIEW rather than of the dataset. At city zoom that is a reduction of two
 * or three orders of magnitude; at globe zoom it correctly returns everything,
 * because everything genuinely is in view.
 *
 * WHY A GRID AND NOT A LIBRARY. This began as rbush, which is the obvious
 * choice and a good one. It could not ship: adding it made Render's build fail
 * three times running with npm's usage dump, while npm ci and the full build
 * both succeeded from a clean clone here — this machine runs npm 11 on Node 25
 * and Render runs Node 24.15, and no amount of regenerating the lockfile
 * reconciled them. A dependency that cannot be deployed is worth nothing, and
 * the index it provided is fifty lines.
 *
 * A uniform grid is also the better fit for this shape of problem. An R-tree
 * earns its complexity on overlapping rectangles of wildly varying size; these
 * are points, and the query is always an axis-aligned box. Bucketing by whole
 * degrees answers that by walking only the cells the box touches — no tree, no
 * rebalancing, and a build that is one pass with no allocation per node.
 *
 * At ten thousand points a plain linear scan is honestly fine, well under a
 * millisecond. It stops being fine at a hundred thousand, which is where this
 * is going: 108,045 military installations and 304,632 mines are already
 * researched and waiting. Building costs one pass when the data loads;
 * querying costs almost nothing, and querying is what happens on every camera
 * move.
 *
 * THE ANTIMERIDIAN IS HANDLED, because it is the thing that quietly breaks
 * every naive bounding-box cull: a view spanning it has a west edge numerically
 * GREATER than its east edge, and a single rectangle query then matches nothing
 * at all. Such a view is split into two queries and the results merged.
