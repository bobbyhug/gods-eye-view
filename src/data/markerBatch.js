/**
 * Batched, non-blocking point markers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Layers drew their markers with Cesium's Entity API — one
 * `entities.add()` per data point. That is the convenient path and the slow
 * one: every entity becomes its own primitive with its own draw call, and its
 * properties are re-evaluated by a visualiser every frame. It is fine for
 * dozens of points and punishing for thousands.
 *
 * Measured on the live site before this existed: switching on the wildfire
 * layer froze the interface for 7.7 SECONDS, and enabling every layer at once
 * stopped the renderer responding altogether. Steady-state rendering was never
 * the problem — the median frame was 1.9 ms — the cost was all in building and
 * maintaining the entities.
 *
 * TWO FIXES, AND BOTH MATTER:
 *
 *   1. ONE DRAW CALL. A PointPrimitiveCollection batches every point into a
 *      single buffer, so ten thousand markers cost about what one costs.
 *
 *   2. BUILT ACROSS FRAMES. Even filling that buffer is expensive at scale, and
 *      doing it in one synchronous loop is exactly what froze the tab. Points
 *      are added in bounded chunks with a yield between them, so the interface
 *      stays responsive and the markers appear progressively instead of the
 *      page locking up and then everything arriving at once.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT FOR. Entities are still the right tool for a handful of rich
 * objects — labels, models, polylines, anything wanting a description or a
 * per-object material. This is for the case that hurts: thousands of plain
 * points that differ only in position, size and colour.
 *
 * IT CANNOT CLAMP TO TERRAIN, and that is the one thing to check before
 * converting a layer. The Entity API offers `heightReference: CLAMP_TO_GROUND`,
 * which drops a marker onto the ground wherever it is; a PointPrimitive sits at
 * exactly the height it is given. A point left at zero is therefore BELOW
 * GROUND anywhere with elevation — buried inside the hill it belongs to, which
 * is a bug this repo has already fixed once, on a layer whose markers vanished
 * in Denver and Zurich.
 *
 * So a layer may only move here if one of these holds:
 *   - it knows its own heights (airports carry field elevation), or
 *   - its points are genuinely at sea level, or
 *   - it can afford to sample terrain once when the data loads.
 * A layer that needs live clamping and has no height of its own should stay on
 * entities. Being fast is not worth being wrong about where something is.
