 * Flight Sim ground contact.

 * The live-aircraft layer's `groundSnap.js` is built for hundreds of contacts
 * sampled rarely, with per-icao rate limiting and held-evidence decay. Flight
 * Sim has the opposite shape: exactly one aircraft that needs a height under it
 * continuously and cheaply. So this reuses the same *principles* — sample the
 * tile skin, cache it, invalidate on movement — sized for a single fast-moving
 * aircraft rather than a crowd.
 *
 * Terrain sampling is the single most expensive thing this mode could do per
 * frame, so it is deliberately throttled: a sample is only taken when the
 * aircraft has moved far enough for the old one to be stale, or enough time has
 * passed. Everything in between reuses the cached height.
