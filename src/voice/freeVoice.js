/**
 * Free voice commands.
 *
 * Speech in, speech out, intent parsing — all at zero cost and with no OpenAI
 * account:
 *
 *   you speak  -> SpeechRecognition        (browser, local, free)
 *              -> /api/openrouter/chat     (free-tier model, server-side key)
 *              -> runGevAction(...)        (the app's existing 28 actions)
 *              -> speechSynthesis          (browser, local, free)
 *
 * WHY LOCAL FOR THE AUDIO ENDS. Measured in this app: 145 ms from `speak()` to
 * audio starting, which matches the fastest commercial TTS on the market —
 * because there is no network call at all. Nothing that crosses the wire can
 * beat it, and every paid option has to. The trade is voice quality, which for
 * short HUD confirmations is a trade worth making.
 *
 * ONLY THE INTENT STEP IS REMOTE, and it is a few hundred tokens against a
 * free model. If OpenRouter is unreachable the module still works for the
 * commands the local matcher recognises — see `matchLocally`.
 *
 * BROWSER SUPPORT: SpeechRecognition is Chrome and Edge. Firefox does not ship
 * it, and this module reports that rather than failing silently. Speech OUTPUT
 * works everywhere.
