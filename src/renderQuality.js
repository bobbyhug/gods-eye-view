/**
 * Global render quality.
 *
 * One setting that governs how much the renderer is allowed to spend on image
 * quality, across the whole app rather than inside any one mode.
 *
 * Two dials do nearly all the visible work:
 *
 *   - `resolutionScale` — the app renders at CSS pixels by default, so on a
 *     Retina display every edge is drawn at half the panel's real density.
 *     Raising this is what removes the stair-stepping on wings, roads and the
 *     horizon. Cost scales with the SQUARE of the value.
 *   - the photoreal tileset's `maximumScreenSpaceError` — inverse quality:
 *     lower means Cesium tolerates less on-screen error and streams sharper
 *     tiles. This is what makes distant ground look detailed instead of
 *     smeared.
 *
 * AUTO is the default and means "let whatever is running decide": Flight Sim
 * measures its own frame times and adapts, and the map sits at Cesium's
 * defaults. Choosing an explicit level pins both dials and turns adaptation
 * off, because a setting the user chose should not be silently overridden.
