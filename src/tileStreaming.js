/**
 * Photorealistic 3D Tiles streaming tuning.
 *
 * The tileset shipped on Cesium's defaults — not one streaming property was
 * set. Defaults are chosen to be safe on a phone over a slow connection, which
 * is the wrong trade for a flight simulator on a desktop: they make detail
 * arrive slowly and then throw it away again the moment the camera moves on.
 *
 * Nothing here changes maximumScreenSpaceError, which is the one knob that
 * costs money: it decides how many tiles exist at all, and lowering it
 * multiplies tile requests by roughly (16/mse)^2. Everything below changes how
 * the tiles you were already going to fetch are ORDERED, CACHED and SHOWN, so
 * the picture sharpens sooner and stays sharp, for the same number of requests.
